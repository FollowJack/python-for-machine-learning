    " * For all figures that you generate, remember to add meaningful labels to the axes, and make a legend, if applicable.\n",
    " * Do not hard code constants, like number of samples, number of channels, etc in your program. These values should always be determined from the given data. This way, you can easily use the code to analyse other data sets.\n",
    " * Do not use high-level functions from toolboxes like scikit-learn.\n",
